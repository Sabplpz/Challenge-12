# Employer Database - Challenge 12

## Description

This command line application was created to help employers keep track of their business departments, roles and employees. You are able to view a formatted table of the departments, roles and employess. You can also add a new role, department or employee within this app. Final functionality for this app is to be able to update an employee's role. I learnt a lot about inquirer and MySQL while coding through this app.
